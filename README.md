Quake port for the Wii based on the GameCube port from Peter Mackay. This project was updated to work for the Wii by EluanCM, Izhido, and Piko.

I updated this project to compile with the latest LiboGC toolchain, and ported over some popular features from more robust Quake engines, namely:

- HLBSP
- External Colored Lighting (LIT) support
- Skybox support
- True transparency support
- Disabled multitexturing in favor of a more efficient rendering pipeline
- As well as many other bug fixes

My main reason for doing so was to prepare a Quake engine on the Wii to be able to support mods such as NZ:P (you can google this to see what it is)
However, I will maintain this port to the best of my ability, and fix bugs as they are reported. 

I do plan on porting other features from my further modified NZ:P engine on Wii built off of this port if there is a demand for it. 

Thanks and cheers,
sB
